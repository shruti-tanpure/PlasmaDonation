    <h2>COVID-19: How Does It Affect You?</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, starts in the respiratory tract. That’s the 
        airway between the mouth, nose, throat, and lungs. It’s the same place that the common cold 
        attacks. But COVID-19 is more likely to get deeper into the respiratory tract.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        When the body spots the virus, the immune system counterattacks. One sign of that is a fever. 
        Infected person might have a cough, too. That’s the body’s usual response to something that’s
        in the airways that shouldn’t be.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        The lungs are the main organs affected by COVID-19. But in serious cases, the rest of the body can
        also be affected. The damage to the organs isn’t always directly caused by the infection but can 
        result from the body’s response to infection.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>What can you do?</h2>
    <ol type="I">
        <br>
        <li><h4>Preventive Actions</h4>
            <br>
            <p>To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Physical distancing — keep a distance of at least 6 feet between you and others outside 
                    of your home.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Proper hand-washing — wash your hands for at least 20 seconds.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Cough or sneeze into your elbow or a tissue and immediately wash your hands.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
            
            <h4>Stay Healthy</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Make a routine of eating a well-balanced diet, drinking plenty of water, getting enough 
                sleep, exercising and monitoring your mental health. Reach out to family and friends 
                for support.
            </p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
            
            <h4>Stay Informed</h4>
            <br>
            <p>With a situation that changes daily, it is crucial to stay informed so you know if any changes 
                have occurred both globally and in your community. Make sure to look for evidence-based 
                sources to avoid misinformation. And take a break from the news when you need it, 
                for your mental health.</p>

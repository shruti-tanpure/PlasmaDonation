    <title>COVID AFTER EFFECTS</title>

    <h1>Most Common 'After-Effects' Of COVID-19 Post Recovery</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>COVID-19 carries long term side-effects</h3>
    <p>
        As infection cases continue to soar nationwide, the evidence is becoming clear that COVID is 
        simply not just a cold or flu-like infection. It poses risk for people across all age groups, 
        in different degrees and affects some more gravely than the others.For many, viral load may have 
        depleted but some typical symptoms, such as cough, itching throat and fatigue may continue to 
        persist for weeks after combatting the illness.
    </p>
    <h3>Fatigue</h3>
    <p>
        It can be tough to get back on your feet post-recovery. With COVID, long-lasting fatigue, weakness 
        (which could persist for weeks and months) has been a much-feared consequence. This occurs after 
        COVID. Most people will get better quickly but some will find their fatigue persists for three to six 
        months. Post-recovery fatigue has also been recorded in the past outbreaks of infections like the 
        SARS and Epstein-Barr virus.
    </p>
    <h3>Breathlessness</h3>
    <p>
        Breathlessness and tugging chest pain could be some of the primary symptoms which could pinpoint 
        how bad your COVID infection is. However, for some patients who have made a recovery from the 
        infection, breathlessness might persist for longer and throw them out of spin. It usually improves as
        the patient regains her fitness, but some people will benefit from assessment by their Doctor or 
        specialist team.
    </p>
    <h3>Memory and cognitive decline</h3>
    <p>
        As per the study's findings, one-quarter of the patients who had either moderate or severe form 
        of COVID admitted to suffering from neuropsychological deficits and related symptoms. Symptoms 
        likened to PTSD post-treatment were also observed. Mental distress, problems in memory comprehension 
        or behaviour could be triggered due to a variety of factors occurring both inside and outside the 
        recovery centre.
    </p>
    <h3>Stress and anxiety</h3>
    <p>
        The lockdown has brought upon unprecedented stress to our lives but for those battling the disease, 
        or who have made a recovery, stress and anxiety could be much harder to combat, making them more 
        likely to suffer from psychological ailments in the long run.
    </p>
    <h3>Degrading quality of life</h3>
    <p>
        Nearly 69% of the patients put under intensive care and 49% of those with mild to moderate 
        infections admitted to suffering from problems in rehabilitating back to their lives. There have 
        been links to the multitude of ways the virus could impact one's lung, heart, nervous system and 
        leave deficits in other vital functioning. A sharp decline and degradation in the quality of life 
        were one of the most commonly observed symptoms in a patient's post-treatment.

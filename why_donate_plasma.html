    <p>In these times when Covid is taking thousands of lives daily, Plasma and oxygen have become two

    <h4>What is Plasma?</h4>
    <p>
        Plasma is basically the liquid part of your blood. Function of plasma is to keep the blood 
        healthy. It carries proteins, minerals, nutrients and hormones to designated places in your body. 
        It contains salts and enzymes which help create anti-bodies which further fight the infection or 
        virus in the body. In Covid it helps the patients fight against the virus through the anti-bodies 
        present in plasma.

    <h4>How Does Plasma Donation Help In Covid?</h4>
    <p>
        According to experts, Plasma is not a cure to Covid but helps fight it and eradicate the virus 
        cells present in the body. When a patient is suffering from Covid-19, her ability to fight the 
        virus decreases due to which the person is unable to recover himself. Plasma donation helps to 
        provide anti-bodies to the patient which assists the cells to overcome the corona virus cells.

    <p>
        Person who has recovered from Covid 14 days prior can donate his plasma as his body must have 
        formed anti-bodies against the virus. Plasma maintains normal blood pressure 
        and blood volume levels in the body which is crucial for a person suffering from Corona.
